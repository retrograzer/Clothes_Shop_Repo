Clothes_Shop_Repo
A short demo about buying clothes and customizing your character. Created for Little Sim World's Programming Interview Test.

All Sprites and Scripts by me, save for the UI sprites by Cryptogene and music by Pascal Stiefel.

WASD movement, E to interact with the shopkeep and wardrobe, left click to interact with menus.

Press Escape (when not in the interaction trigger) to exit to the main menu

Item ID Directory
-----------------
Side Note: I'm sure there's a better way to do saving and loading of what articles I've bought or not,
but just like how I'm doing cosmetics I'm just going to go for the long way and see if I can sus out the
short way during the process. If I find a better way I'll come back and edit this note. Obviously this would technically work
but the more items that you start to add, the crazier the JSON is gonna get. For sim games I guess that's pretty normal, after all there's
a TON to save and load but still there's probably a way less tedious way to do it.
